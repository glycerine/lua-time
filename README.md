Time
====

This is a MIT licensed library for the manipulation of dates and periods according to the Gregorian calendar, i.e. the internationally accepted calendar for most uses. The library is built around two concepts:

+ **date**: a specific point in time, for example yesterday at 3:00 PM;
+ **period**: a duration of time, for example three hours.

with the following characteristics:

+ dates and periods have microsecond (1-millionth of a second) precision;
+ leap years are taken into account;
+ all years have the same number of seconds, i.e. there are no leap seconds.

The Sci library is part of the <a href="http://www.scilua.org">SciLua</a> framework which aims to offer a framework for numerical computing which combines the ease of use of scripting languages (Matlab, R, ...) with the high performance of compiled languages (C/C++, Fortran, ...). Please refer to the project's homepage for more information.
